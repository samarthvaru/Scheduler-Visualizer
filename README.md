# Process Scheduling Simulator

This project is a web-based process scheduling simulator that allows users to simulate different process scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FIFO), Round Robin, Shortest Job First (SJF), and Uni-programming in Python. It provides a visual representation of the process execution using Chart.js.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. Enter process details including Process ID, Arrival Time, and Burst Time.
5. Click "Add Process" to add more processes if needed.
6. Click "Run Simulation" to start the simulation.
7. Once the simulation completes, the execution order and the chart will be displayed.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the user interface.
- `jquery-3.6.0.min.js`: jQuery library for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.

## Dependencies

- [Chart.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js): JavaScript library for rendering charts.
- [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js): jQuery library for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.

Note: This project requires an internet connection to load external dependencies (Chart.js and jQuery) from CDN.
